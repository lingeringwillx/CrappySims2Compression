Refpack/QFS is a compression algorithm based on the LZ77/LZSS compression by Frank Barchard from EA. It first appeared in Need for Speed 2 in 1997. There is slight variations in the compression for each game.

The main destinction between QFS and LZSS is that the compression has it's own unique way of encoding tokens/control characters, which has a varying length between 8 to 32 bits.

It also allows a much longer length and offset to be encoded.

The algorithm doesn't employ any other common compression method (such as Huffman Coding) besides eliminating repeated patterns like the LZSS.

The longer length and offset increases CPU and memory usage, and it doesn't seem to yield a significant improvement in the compressed size, so I don't know why EA didn't just use DEFLATE. I guess they waited until the patent for DEFLATE died?
